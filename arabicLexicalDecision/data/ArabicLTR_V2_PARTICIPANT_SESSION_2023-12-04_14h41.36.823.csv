You have to be 18 years old or older to participate in this study or with a parent's permission. </i></h><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>You have been invited to participate in a research study to learn more about the nature of word perception. This study is funded by New York University Abu Dhabi and approved by the NYUAD IRB. The study is directed by Prof. David Melcher, Professor of Psychology at New York University Abu Dhabi.</p><p><b>Procedure</b></p><p>Before starting the experiment, we kindly request some demographic information from you. This may include details such as your gender, age, and ethnicity. During the experiment, you will encounter a series of Arabic words. Your task will be to respond to specific prompts or questions related to these words. The experiment aims to gather insights into your reading and comprehension of Arabic language stimuli.</p><p><b>Risks and benefits</b></p><p>Please read through this section. If after reading the section you do not wish to participate, then feel free to inform the experimenter and end your participation at any point without further explanation. Even after the study has started, you can withdraw at any time. There are no known significant risks or side effects with this experiment. The images or sounds will be presented at safe levels. Some observers may experience fatigue or eyestrain as a result of extended computer viewing, so it is recommended that you take advantage of scheduled breaks or rest when needed. In the case of any general emergency on campus that also affects this location, there are documented standard operating procedures (SOPs) to properly handle these situations, and our research staff, as well as the Public Safety personnel, are trained to handle emergency situations. Feel free to ask for the emergency SOP procedure before commencing the experiment. You will receive no direct risks from participation in this study. However, this research may contribute to our understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie sensory perception.</p><p><b>Costs and compensation</b></p><p>You will receive an Amazon voucher for 30 AED per half hour of the study. Or, you can choose to receive class credit for 0.5 credit per half hour. Should you withdraw before the end of the study, this allowance will be given based on the time that has passed (i.e., if you complete between 0-0.5 hours of the study you will receive a subsistence allowance of 30 Dirhams or 0.5 credit; if you complete between 0.5-1 hours of the study you will receive a subsistence allowance of 60 Dirhams or 1 credit. There will be no cost to you associated with participation in this study.</p><p><b>Rights</b></p><p>Participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any time without penalty. Nonparticipation or withdrawal will not affect your grades, academic standing, or employment status. If there is anything about the study or your participation that is unclear or that you do not understand, or if you have questions or wish to report a research-related problem, you may contact the Principal Investigator, Prof. David Melcher, at dm93@nyu.edu. For more information or questions about your rights as a research participant, or if you are not satisfied with the manner in which this study is being carried out, you may contact the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at New York University Abu Dhabi (IRBnyuad@nyu.edu; +971.2.628.4000).</p><p><b>Confidentiality</b></p><p>Confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained. Your personal information (name, vision value, etc.) will be stored separately from your data. Your personal information will be used only if you request the compensation, for the purposes of the compensation. All other data will only be linked to a code number. The code key connecting your name to specific information about you will be kept in a separate, secure location. All the recorded data will be stripped out of your personal information and only linked to you with a unique subject identifier.</p><p>The results of this study may be published in a book, journal, or conference, or used for teaching purposes. However, your name or any other identifiers that could identify you will not be used in any publication or teaching materials. Your data may be shared anonymously (that is, without identifying whom the data belongs to) for teaching purposes, research (such as in academic databases), or displayed at scientific conferences or in publications.</p><p>Provided we get your consent, your non-anonymized data may also be shared with other researchers at NYUAD, depending on your response to these questions (about sharing this data with other projects) during the informed consent process. The reason for including non-anonymized data would only be in order to combine some data from one study with data from another study for the same participant.</p><p><b>  Do you consent to participate in this experiment? </b></p>""]","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
